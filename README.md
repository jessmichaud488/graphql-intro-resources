## :wave: Hello!

This respository provides links to resources mentioned in the Workshop, along with a few extra ones for good measure. These have been collected together in [resources](resources.md).

You can also find sample answers for all of the exercises of the workshop. These have been split into the [queries](queries.md) and [mutations](mutations.md). These answers are just a way of achieving things. If your answer is different but is still able to answer the question then that's great :rocket:
